Catenaccio is a defensive formation that originated in Italy and was made famous by the likes of Inter Milan and AC Milan in the 1960s. The formation is characterized by a strict man-marking system, a deep defensive line, and a sweeper (the libero) at the back who is responsible for mopping up any attacks that break through the defense.

To set up the catenaccio formation in FM23, follow these steps:

Start a new game in FM23 and select your team.

In the tactics screen, choose the "Formation" tab and select the 4-4-2 formation.

In the "Team Instructions" tab, select "Very Defensive" for the team mentality. This will ensure that your players stay compact and defend as a unit.

In the "Player Instructions" tab, select "Man Marking" for the marking system. This will ensure that each player is assigned to mark a specific opponent, making it difficult for the opposition to play through your defense.

In the "Player Roles" tab, assign one of your central defenders as a "Sweeper". The sweeper will act as the last line of defense and will be responsible for intercepting any attacks that break through your defensive line.

In the "Player Instructions" tab, select "Close Down More" for the closing down instruction. This will instruct your players to aggressively close down the opposition and prevent them from having time on the ball.

In the "Team Instructions" tab, select "Play Out of Defense" for the playing style. This will instruct your team to play the ball out from the back, using the sweeper as a pivot to build attacks from deep.

By following these steps, you should be able to set up the catenaccio formation in FM23 and employ a strict and organized defensive system. Keep in mind that the catenaccio formation is not suitable for teams that rely on possession and attacking football, as it is focused primarily on defense. However, if used correctly, it can be a highly effective way to frustrate and nullify the opposition.
