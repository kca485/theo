In FM23, finding wonderkids can be a great way to build a successful team for the future. These highly-rated young players have the potential to develop into world-class stars and lead your team to victory.

To find wonderkids in FM23, you can use the game's scouting system. This allows you to search for players based on various criteria, such as position, age, and potential ability. By focusing on young players with high potential ability ratings, you can identify players who have the potential to become wonderkids.

Another way to find wonderkids in FM23 is to pay attention to the game's news feeds. These will often highlight young players who have been performing well and are starting to attract attention from bigger clubs. By keeping an eye on these news feeds, you can stay up-to-date on the latest young talent and potentially add some of these players to your squad.

In Football Manager 23, the best attribute to look for when trying to find wonderkids is their potential ability. This attribute is an estimation of how good a player can become over the course of their career. You can find a player's potential ability by viewing their player profile and looking under the "Attributes" section. It's important to note that potential ability is not a guarantee of how good a player will become, and can be affected by factors such as the player's development and the level of training they receive. Additionally, potential ability can vary between different versions of Football Manager, so it's always a good idea to do your research and consult with other players to get a sense of which attributes are most important in the version you're playing.

In addition to using the game's scouting system and news feeds, you can also use player recommendations from your assistant manager and other members of your coaching staff. These recommendations can be a great way to identify players who may not be well-known but have the potential to become top-class players.

Overall, finding wonderkids in FM23 requires a combination of using the game's scouting system, staying up-to-date on the latest news and player performances, and considering player recommendations from your coaching staff. By using these methods, you can identify and sign the best young talent and build a team for the future.
