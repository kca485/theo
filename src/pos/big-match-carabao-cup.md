Brighton battled for the Carabao Cup title when the draw revealed that the opponent to face was Chelsea. Not without reason, so far, if you encounter the big teams in the Premier League, then of course the draw is already very good, and even tend to lose. 

This time, things were different. With the majority of the team being talented young players, supported by a fairly hectic training schedule, Brighton challenged Chelsea tenaciously.

Round 1 began with a 0-1 lead for Brighton through Szoboszlai's strike from Matias Arezo's sweet pass. These two key players are getting more and more capable in terms of connection on the field. Meanwhile Chelsea had equalised in the 35th minute through Ziyech's strike. However it was annulled by the referee because Ziyech was in an offiside position.

The 2nd half was no less exciting, just starting in the 47th minute of Estupinan, the young left wing-back was able to blast the ball into Kepa's goal from a pass from Mac Allister. The lead grew 0-2 for Brighton. 

The last goal was scored by Mac Allister in the 93rd minute via a close-range shot that Kepa, the Chelsea goalkeeper, could not anticipate. The final score of 0-3 lasted until the game was over.
