The 2022/2023 CARABAO CUP SEASON final brings together two mid-table teams. Brighton vs Crystal Palace. Both advanced to the final after many passing through hurdles from English league teams from both the Premier League and Skybet Championship.

**Analysis of Brighton tactics**

Based on the analysis table of those CARABAO CUP teams, Brighton has a good record. Brighton dominated the goal tally with 20 goals. Meanwhile, another interesting note is that Brighton in 5 matches recorded 4 wins and 1 draw. This achievement cannot be separated from the tactics used by Brighton during the competition.

Using the 433 tactic scheme by relying on attacks from the middle side, is one of the phases of good attack and defense. Not only that, but Brighton were also able to give Crystal Palace players a tight press until in the 46th minute, a goal was born from the feet of Leandro Trossard.

The dominance of the game is equally strong. But by relying on tight pressing from the central area to the front, Brighton's players were able to provide goal-scoring opportunities. There were at least 12 shots that Brighton players made. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace recorded 11 shots.

The attack pattern is built from the rear to the front. Thomas McGill with a position as SK (sweeper keeper) often delivers long balls directly into the opponent's defensive area. Thus, then the opponent's concentration can be split. This makes it easier for Brighton's central and lone forwards to find the ideal position in the fight for the ball.

The data below shows how the Brighton attack pattern goes. By relying on measured short passing, Brighton dominated the ball game in the back area enough to the heart of the opponent's defense.

This 433 gegenpressing tactic puts forward how determined the players are, mastery of the central area, and creating opportunities in tight spaces. Not infrequently, as much as possible, get a foul in the penalty box. This is of course an advantage in itself, right?
