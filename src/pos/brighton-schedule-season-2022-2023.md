The journey of the club nicknamed Seagull was not easy from the beginning. With the Premiere League schedule being tight and also competitive, forcing Brighton to have maximum squad depth. As far as this half-season journey has been traveled with great struggle. Although, it already has additional ammunition that is fairly capable, but the adaptation of these new retainers also needs to be used as a separate note.

Looks impressive, doesn't it? With the tight schedule, and the adaptation process of the new retainers, the results obtained are not bad. Considering the top 3 position is a pretty decent position to keep until the end of the season later. On the other hand, the top teams of the Premiere League have begun to be sultry with the results of this fairly competitive game. It can be seen that the dismissal of several coaches such as Graham Potter (Chelsea) and Erik Ten Hag (Manchester United) is not a trivial matter. The tightness of the player's schedule and fitness, as well as dark horse clubs such as Brighton, Wolves and others, is the biggest challenge.

Also, Brighton's club officials also set a season-end target that was enough to sultry the new manager. The previous achievements of the coach, indirectly put tremendous pressure on to pass on. 

Last word, the biggest question is.... "Can We Survive?"
