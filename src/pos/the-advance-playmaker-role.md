An advance playmaker, also known as a "false nine," is a soccer position that has gained popularity in recent years. This role is characterized by a forward who drops deep into midfield to receive the ball and create scoring opportunities for their teammates.

The advance playmaker is a highly creative and technically skilled player who is comfortable with the ball at their feet and can make passes to unlock defenses. They are often tasked with dictating the tempo of the game and orchestrating attacks from deep within the midfield.

One of the key features of the advance playmaker role is the ability to drift out wide and create space for other attacking players. This can be especially effective against teams that employ a high defensive line, as the advance playmaker can draw defenders out of position and create openings for their teammates to exploit.

One player who has been successful in this role is Lionel Messi, who has often played as an advance playmaker for both Barcelona and the Argentine national team. Messi's vision, dribbling ability, and passing range make him a formidable threat in this position, and he has scored many goals and created numerous chances for his teammates from this role.

While the advance playmaker role requires a high level of technical ability, it also requires a strong tactical understanding and the ability to read the game. Players in this role must be able to identify and exploit weaknesses in the opposition's defense, and they must also be able to adapt to different tactical situations as the game progresses.

Overall, the advance playmaker role is an important one in modern soccer, and it requires a special blend of technical skills and tactical awareness. Players who excel in this role can have a major impact on their team's attacking play, and they are often the creative spark that drives their team's success.
