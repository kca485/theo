The role of a ball playing defender, also known as a center back or sweeper, is an important position in modern soccer. These players are responsible for organizing the defense, starting attacks from the back, and often serving as the last line of defense against the opposition's attacks.

One of the key responsibilities of a ball playing defender is to be a leader on the field. They are often tasked with communicating with their teammates, organizing the defense, and making sure that everyone is in the right position. This involves reading the game, anticipating the opposition's movements, and making quick, decisive decisions under pressure.

In addition to their defensive duties, ball playing defenders are also expected to contribute to the team's attack. This can involve playing long passes to launch counter-attacks, or bringing the ball out of the back and starting attacks with short, precise passes. To be effective in this role, a ball playing defender needs to have excellent technical skills, including good ball control, passing ability, and vision.

Another important aspect of the ball playing defender role is physicality. These players are often called upon to win aerial duels, make tackles, and win 50/50 challenges. To excel in these areas, a ball playing defender needs to be strong, quick, and agile.

Overall, the role of a ball playing defender requires a combination of technical, tactical, and physical skills. These players are the backbone of a team's defense and play a vital role in both the attack and defense. If you have a passion for soccer and enjoy the challenges of playing in defense, the ball playing defender role might be the perfect fit for you.
