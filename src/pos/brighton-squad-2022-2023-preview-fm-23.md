A large transfer budget, of course, is synonymous with the temptation of spending promising and hopeful players. But what if we invest for the next 5-10 years for young players or what we usually refer to as wonderkids?

With a transfer budget of 70 million, what can be bought and obtained?

Those players were all bought with consideration for strengthening on some of the main lines which was certainly useful in the following season.

With the addition of Matias Arezo main target in the striker position, Amar Dedic in the full-back position on the right and left, coupled with Dominik Szoboszlai as a playmaker with a natural position on the left wing, it can also be in the central midfielder position.

So far, the Uruguayan striker has been able to adapt to Brighton's tactics that provide the role of a pressing striker. In almost every game Arezo always scored for Brighton. Collecting a total of 11 goals in all his appearances is really impresive isn't it?!

Meanwhile, 20-year-old Amar Dedic is starting to play his crucial role as a fullback capable of attacking and defending at the same time. In addition to helping build the attack, with his 3 assists, Amar Dedic made a significant contribution in each of his performances!

Passing, chance creation, composure is the skills of the 22-year-old Hungarian. With a variety of positions ranging from winger, and center midfielder Dominik has always dominated the game in the middle with his beautiful passes, high accuracy passing, and decision makers who may still need improvement going forward.

Brighton is currently in 3rd place in the Premier League and hopefully this position will last until at least towards the end of the 2022/2023 season.
