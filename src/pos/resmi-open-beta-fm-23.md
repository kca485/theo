Exactly 2 days after the open beta was released on steam, epic and other platforms, with a long wait and mixed expectations, Football Manager 2023 comes with the addition of features that are said to be even more accurate!

Although it is still open beta, it still leaves a lot of improvements to overcome bugs that really need to be looked at further. One of the bugs in the form of a glitch effect found by fmscout on its youtube channel shows that Sport Interactive needs to really listen to the fm community more carefully.

Many are still dissatisfied with the presence of fm 23 because it is felt that there are no significant changes from the previous series.

Even the Football Manager seems ignorant and doesn't care about criticism about their gameplay graphics which are decreasing drastically. Although on the other hand, the improvements made still need to be appreciated, especially in the improvement of player data, scouting and others.

Next, we will try to review the features of FM 2023 in detail and in depth!
