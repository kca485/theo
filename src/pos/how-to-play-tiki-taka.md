The tiki taka tactic is a possession-based style of play that originated from the Spanish national team and has been adopted by many club teams as well. The key elements of this tactic include short passes, movement off the ball, and fluid interchanges between players. Here's how to set up a tiki taka tactic in a soccer game:

1. Formation: The most common formation used in tiki taka is the 4-3-3. This formation provides a good balance between defense and attack, with four defenders, three midfielders, and three forwards. The midfielders should be evenly split between defensive, central, and attacking roles to provide flexibility and support in all areas of the pitch.
2. Player instructions: In order to effectively implement the tiki taka tactic, players need to be given specific instructions. The defenders should be told to play a high defensive line, which will put pressure on the opposition and allow for quick counter-attacks. The midfielders should be instructed to keep possession and make short, accurate passes. The forwards should be told to make runs off the ball and look for opportunities to score.
3. Team instructions: The team instructions play a crucial role in setting up the tiki taka tactic. The most important instruction is to play out of defense, which means that the team should try to build attacks from the back rather than launching long balls forward. Other important instructions include keeping possession, playing short passes, and moving the ball quickly.
4. Opposition instructions: In order to effectively implement the tiki taka tactic, it's important to tailor your instructions to the specific opposition you're facing. For example, if the opposition is strong in the air, you may want to instruct your defenders to play a lower defensive line to limit the space for crosses. If the opposition is strong on the counter-attack, you may want to instruct your midfielders to sit deeper and protect the defense.

Overall, setting up a tiki taka tactic requires a combination of formation, player instructions, team instructions, and opposition instructions. By carefully considering each of these elements, you can create a fluid and dynamic attacking style that can be difficult for the opposition to defend against.
