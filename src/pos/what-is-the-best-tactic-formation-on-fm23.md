It's difficult to say what the best attacking formation tactic is in Football Manager 23, as it largely depends on the players you have at your disposal and the style of play you prefer. That being said, there are a few tactics that have been known to be effective in previous versions of the game.

One tactic that has been successful in Football Manager is the 4-2-3-1 formation. This formation puts four defenders at the back, two central midfielders, three attacking midfielders, and one striker up front. The two central midfielders can provide support to the defense while also linking up with the attacking midfielders and striker to create scoring opportunities.

Another tactic that has proven to be effective is the 4-3-3 formation. This formation features three forwards – a central striker and two wingers – who can stretch the opposition's defense and create space for the central striker to exploit. The three midfielders provide support both defensively and offensively, allowing for a balanced approach to the game.

Ultimately, the best attacking formation for you will depend on the players you have and the style of play you prefer. Experiment with different tactics and formations to find the one that works best for your team.
